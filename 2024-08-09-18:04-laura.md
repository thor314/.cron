What should the laura check in 'n thank contain? I think I want to express:
- I appreciated her making the effort to find time to talk, and clarifying that she wanted to be friends
  - her story about ships in an ocean was beautiful
  - her check in made me feel i could trust her to make effort in being friends, whatever that ends up being
- more concrete guidelines on what space means for me, and what kind of friends we would be
  - i dont think I will avoid her at fusion, but I also will probably take at least a month before I feel okay talking to her again, and I would like to make that initiation
  - If we do reconnect, I should warn her that I may abruptly leave if I feel weird around her and maybe tell her why later
  - Also warn that if we become friends that would feel like non-zero effort, and I would feel double extra not great if I had to do things like do all the managing and planning time spent around one another and would probably ghost if I felt that
  - that I'm not sure what friends means to her, but to me it generally means we could talk about things, that she would be invited to stuff we're hosting at house, and that I would have high trust in her to tell me things about, well, things. 
  - I'm not sure if it means we could hang out dyadically. I am nervous about investing that kind of energy into a connection with her, and finding myself on the end of inscrutible rejection.
- do i want to tell her im okay? no. I'm sending her this message, which implies that i'm okay, no redundancy
- say joke: I would totally hit on her if I was a random dude and I saw her at a tesla charging station

smash send
