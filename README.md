# Usage:
maintain a local copy of crontabs in crontab. Copy paste into system crontab (edit with `crontab -e`). Store cron scripts here.

## known bugs: mostly git
- `github_name` still seems to have errors with cron-key stuff
- `git_merkle` is still pretty untested, but seems to work occasionally`
- need to do overhaul on anything that touches git submodules
